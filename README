Introduction: In Microsoft Visual Basic 6 (VB6) the MSComm.ocx way of using serial ports is not valid for ports above 16.
Quote (MSComm Help file): CommPort Property
  "You can set value to any number between 1 and 16"

The class in this repository can be used with ports below and above the 16 port boundary.
It contains standardized public functions, for example, to set up a port, open, read, write and close the port.
The class can be instantiated for one com port or say a series in an array.

To make test harness/demonstrator for VB6 Serial API class...

Need:
* VB6 form:  frmVB6serialAPItest.frm
* VB6 class: clsVB6serialAPI.cls
* Microsoft VB6 development system able to run under say WinXP or Win7
The form is just an example of the public functions in the class being called.
The public functions in the class all return a text string with error message and most return a blank string if the operation suceeded. 

Sequence:
* Create new folder. Suggested name: vb6SerialAPI
* Copy Form and Class (two files) into this folder
* Launch VB6 development system, New Project, New Standard Exe, Open
* Remove Form1 (Right click on it to get drop down menu, select Remove)
* Add form existing frmVB6serialAPItest.frm
* Add class existing clsVB6serialAPI.cls
* Project (tab)/Project Properties...
*   Startup Object - select form just copied into folder from dropdown box.
*   Project Name   - vb6SerialAPI
* Run
* Check form with buttons appears and vb6SerialAPI.vbp was created in new folder.
